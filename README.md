<h1>30 Days Of CSS üë©‚Äçüíª</h1>
<br>
<p>30 Days of CSS is a challenge to help you improve your coding skills by doing mini daily projects using HTML and CSS.</p>


<h2>Rules</h2>
<br>
This challenge is inspired by Milena Carecho next to some youtube channels (Online Tutorials, Creative Creations, Dark Code) as references for the challenges.
In this repository, there are some rules as a suggestion:

‚Ä¢ Carry out a new project every day (not necessarily for 30 days in a row)
‚Ä¢ Do not repeat a project already created
‚Ä¢ The project must be completed until 11:59pm

Feel free to participate! üöÄ
